# local-recall

an entirely open source and locally running recall assistant. <br/> <br/>
no one in their right mind should be trusting a tech giant to deal with data as sensitive as literally everything you do on your pc. 
even if they say everything runs locally. there's always analytics and anonymisation and details hidden deep in privacy policies that no one cares to read thouroughly/at all.  <br/> <br/>

stay tuned.
